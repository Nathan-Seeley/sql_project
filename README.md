### By comparing the amount of reviews per month with the neighbourhood group and price I found that the key factor to a successful AirBnB rental in this market is the location, mainly Brooklyn and Manhattan.  In particular Brooklyn with sixty-nine reviews.  As a side note-price did not seem to be a key factor in determining the success, but an equivilent as to what type of room was being rented. ###
